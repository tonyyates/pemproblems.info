Post Event Messaging Info is a community-compiled resource for finding and sharing information about Post Event Messaging (PEM) in order to help organisations better understand, implement, and use PEM within their services.


### What is PEM?
Post Event Messaging (PEM) in the context of NHS 111 is an electronic document, that is transmitted to GP practices at the end of an NHS 111 Call. There are essentially two types of PEM a GP can receive, one that is ‘for action’ meaning a GP has been referred back to their own GP with a timeframe associated with it. The other is a ‘for information’ message, which is for the GP to inspect and file against the patients record.
