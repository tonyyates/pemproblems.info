### Do I get one at the end of every call?

GP’s shouldn’t be getting one at the end of every call. They should receive a message each time if the outcome was ‘for action’ this means the patient has been told to see their own GP.

When a patient is referred to OOH then 111 should not be sending a PEM to the GP, this is to avoid duplication and has resulted in a significant reduction in PEM’s to GP’s.

There is also a never send list, that 111 systems are told to check and suppress a message being generated at all. These are:

* DX 28 – Contact Pharmacist
* DX 52 – Refer to Police
* DX 60 – Contact Optician next routine appointment within 72 hours
* DX 22 – To be seen by Dental Practice within 3 working days
* DX 23 – Contact Orthodontist next working day
* DX 45 – Provide Service Location Information
* DX 46 – Refer to Health Information
* DX 63 – Refer to Fluline

This list has the desired effect of reducing the volume of PEMs without creating clinical risk given the nature of these referrals. However, the proportion of calls contained within this list is small (1.9%), and hence the reduction is likewise low. This list is reviewed as part of each NHS Pathways version release by the Regional Clinical Leads.

### Why can’t it just work the same as Out of Hours does?

The issue relates to the fact that NHS 111 is a nationally available number, although routing calls is very accurate it cannot be guaranteed that a GP’s patients will be handled by the local 111 service. This can be due to border issues, new mobile masts that haven't been assigned to the area they are in and other factors that cannot be controlled. Water can also carry mobile phone signals much further distances and make it possible for a mobile mast further away to be connected to a mobile handset.

### Will I still receive a PEM message if the patient has been referred to me for onward care?

### Why am I receiving Faxes?

### Why am I receiving different versions of PEM?
