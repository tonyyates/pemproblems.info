### Electronic transmission of discharge summaries

**34.25** As part of the move towards common digital standards, interoperable clinical information systems and a paperless NHS, new contractual requirements are being introduced with effect from 1 October 2015 in relation to Discharge Summaries and (for 111 services) Post-Event Messages.

**34.26** There are two aspects to the new requirements, which are set out in `SC11.6` and in the definition of the Delivery Method.

**34.27** The first relates to the Delivery Method for Discharge Summaries and Post-Event Messages and applies to Discharge Summaries and (for 111 services) Post-Event Messages

+ sent by any provider of Acute services or by any NHS Trust / NHS Foundation Trust
+ to any GP or NHS Trust / NHS Foundation Trust.
￼￼

The change is that, for the above situations, use of secure fax is no longer permitted as a Delivery Method with effect from **1 October 2015 – Discharge Summaries and Post-Event Messages must instead be sent by secure email or direct electronic transmission.**

There is strong encouragement that organisations should adopt a direct electronic transmission approach for sending Discharge Summaries and this should use the “Transfers of Care” Interoperability Toolkit specifications that are aligned with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges endorsed clinical headings. These will be available from March 2015 at HSCIC TRUD.


**34.28** The second new requirement is on all providers to be able to send and receive Discharge Summaries or Post-Event Messages using all applicable Delivery Methods. For situations other than those described in `34.27` above, the ‘applicable’ Delivery Method for particular providers should be set out in Schedule 2J (Transfer of and Discharge from Care Protocols) – this could set out, for instance, that, where discharge summaries are being sent to a care home, this could continue to be done by fax.


**34.29** Commissioners should take a reasonable and proportionate approach in managing performance against the new requirements. They should focus initially on ensuring that providers can provide electronic discharge summaries for GPs within their local catchment area and must support providers in resolving any issues about GP preparedness (in terms of IT systems) to receive electronic discharge summaries.
